## Black box testing

### Polynomial
A polynomial multiplied by one returns the same polynomial.

A polynomial multiplied by zero returns zero.

If a polynomial is added and subtracted to another polynomial the result is equal to the latter.

If a polynomial is multiplied and divided to another polynomial the result equals to the latter.

A polynomial must have the same number of roots as its degree.

A zero polynomial has no defined degree.

### Linear System

A linar system whose poles have negative real part is stable. (3.4.3)

An asympthotically stable transfer function gain for a step input is the value at zero.

The initial value of a system is the limit to infinity of its transfer function.

A linear system can be represented both with state-space representation of with transfer function.

A single input single output system can be transformed between state-representation and transfer function forms.

The poles of a system are equal to the eigenvalues of the A matrix.

A system with no null eigenvalues has a unique equilibrium state. (3.3, 3.4.6)

A system with null eigenvalues has a none or infinite equilibrium states. (3.3)

An asympthotically stable system response after enough time is indipendent from the initial state. (3.4.6)

The response to an inpulse of the state and the output tends to zero. (3.4.6)

The response of the state and the output to an input limited in time tends to zero. (3.4.6)
